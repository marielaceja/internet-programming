        <br />In this lab, we worked with simple PHP commands and did an LED Board with multiple functions to perform different actions within the board.
        Through this lab, I was able to learn a little bit of PHP and its rules such as applying a '$' symbol to every variable being used. This will be helpful
        later on when I get into depth with PHP.

        <br />In this lab, with 3 other colleges, we were able to create several php functions to display a game of silvejack. In this game, a final winner/winners will be displayed at the end.
