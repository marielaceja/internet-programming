    <br />In this lab, we performed basic HTML and CSS to create a website. I was able to learn some new HTML and CSS rules which will help me create a better website in the future.

    <br />In this lab, we worked with simple PHP commands and did an LED Board with multiple functions to perform different actions within the board.
    Through this lab, I was able to learn a little bit of PHP and its rules such as applying a '$' symbol to every variable being used. This will be helpful
    later on when I get into depth with PHP.
